<strong>INTRO</strong> - Let me give you the overview while I get you a cuppa!

Hi, I'm Kev! A thirty-something ADHD fella, struggling with sparse facial hair. You'll find me somewhere under a pile of cats! My partner-in-crime is a very tall German lady who is my inspiration, my muse and my emotional coach through life.

Like a typical human being, there's a lot to me. I'm driven, passionate, free-spirited and confident. I have a strong set of core values I adhere to, no matter where or what I'm doing in life. I have a few hobbies; trying (and failing) to learn the violin, creative writing, reading, hobbyist games dev, petting cats and gaming. One of those 'hobbies' cutely insists on a lot more attention than the others. Can you guess which one?

I suffer with a few select items of poor genetics! Crohn's Disease, ADHD and MADD. Because of these disabilities, I'm a vocal advocate for Mental Health Awareness and Wellbeing, Disability Rights in the Workplace and a 'Human-First, Employee-Second' approach to Leadership. I believe in Trust, Integrity, Compassion and Support. We're all humans, so let's all treat each other like humans first and foremost. I'll get my protest board out and give you the lecture later!

I won't get too deep into my professional life, but I've been working with Unity and C# for a decade. Straight out of university, basically. Ahhh, what a fresh-faced young developer I was! I do enjoy some personal programming with other tools though. I made a Discord Bot to annoy my friends, plenty of MonoGame/XNA stuff in the past. I'm trying my luck with Godot and Unreal Engine. And I really miss my time working at a very low-level with C++. It might be time to get back on that too!

You can find information below about my values, my hobbies, my background and, of course, my cats! Well, if you're interested that is!
