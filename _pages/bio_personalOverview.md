Hi, I'm Kev! A thirty-something ADHD fella, struggling with sparse facial hair and hidden under a pile of cats! My partner-in-crime is a very tall German lady who is my inspiration, my muse and my emotional coach through life.

Like a typical human being, there's a lot to me. I'm driven, passionate, free-spirited and confident. I have a strong set of core values I adhere to, no matter where or what I'm doing in life. I have a few hobbies; trying (and failing) to learn the violin, creative writing, reading, hobbyist games dev, petting cats and gaming. One of those 'hobbies' cutely insists on a lot more attention than the others. Can you guess which one?

You can find information about my values, my hobbies, my background and of course, my cats below, if you're interested!
