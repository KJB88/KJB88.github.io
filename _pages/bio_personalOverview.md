Hi, I'm Kev! A thirty-something ADHD fella, struggling with sparse facial hair and crushed under the weight of too many cats! My partner-in-crime is a very tall German lady who is my inspiration, muse and and emotional coach through life.

Like a typical human being, there's a lot to me. I'm driven, passionate and confident. I have a strong set of core values
I adhere to, no matter where or what I'm doing in life. I have a few hobbies; trying (and failing) to learn the violin, creative writing, reading, personal programming, petting cats and gaming. One of those cutely insists on a lot more attention than the others. Guess which!

You can find information about my values, my cats, my hobbies and my history below, if you're interested!
