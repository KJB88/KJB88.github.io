Hi, I'm Kev! A thirty-something ADHD fella, struggling with sparse facial hair and too many cats! My partner-in-crime is a
very tall German lady who is my inspiration, muse and and emotional coach through life.

Like a typical human being, there's a lot to me. I'm driven, passionate and confident. I have a strong set of core values
I adhere to, no matter where or what I'm doing in life. I have a few hobbies; creative writing, reading, personal programming,
petting cats and gaming. One of those cutely insists on a lot more attention than the others. Guess which!

I've split my history, interests/hobbies, cats and values into their own sections below. Just because I love a bit of organisation
and structure.
