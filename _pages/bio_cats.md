<strong>The Grand Finale</strong>
<br />
Cats! Cats everywhere! A big part of my life are my cats; Arthas, the black and white tuxedo boy. He's 4 and a half. He's the boss around here. And Luna, the big tortoiseshell girl. She's 3 and a half and loves to eat. There's also little Loki, the voidling trickster. She's 2 and a half. She loves to zoom and play with Arthas! And last, but not least, there's Gismo! Gismo is my partner's chunky tonkinese boy! He'll be moving in with the rest of his sisters and brother once we're all set!
