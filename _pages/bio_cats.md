    <h6>The Grand Finale</h6>
    <br>
    Cats! Cats everywhere! A big part of my life are my cats; Arthas, the black and white tuxedo boy. He's 4 and a half. He's the boss around here. And Luna, the big tortoiseshell girl. She's 3 and a half and loves to eat. There's also little Loki, the voidling trickster. She's 2 and a half. She loves to zoom and play with Arthas! And last, but not least, there's Gismo! Gismo is my partner's 12 year old, chunky, tonkinese old man! He'll be joining us here in the mad house when my fiancé and I lock down a wedding date.

    <h6>Arthas - The King</h6>

    This is Arthas! Named after the Lich King of the Scourge from World of Warcraft. Yes, it's nerdy. No, it wasn't <em>purely</em> my decision! Both myself and an ex gave him the rather geeky name. But I love him all the same. He was originally my sister's kitten, but due to circumstance, she wasn't able to keep him. Rather than him have to go to a shelter, I took him as my first cat. He's a sweet boy, but loves to show off that he runs the place to his little sisters. He's affectionate on his terms, but he loves a good nap during the day - especially if I can join him! He'll lay on my chest and go to sleep in a little loaf.

    <h6>Luna - The Queen</h6>

    This is Luna! She's the QUEEN of the house! She's not <em>a</em> queen, all my cat-children are neutered, but she runs around acting like the Queen! She's big, but so gentle and timid. She is easily scared by conflict, loud noises and new people. Rather than drop Arthas with a well placed swipe from her big beefy paw, she'd rather run away out of his reach and go to sleep. She absolutely LOVES food. She cannot regulate her own eating! I had to buy 3 microchip-locked feeders just because this big lady wouldn't stop eating <em>everything</em>! Luna was a shelter-cat that my ex and I took on to give the beautiful lady a new, loving home.

    <h6>Loki - The Trickster</h6>
    <img src="/assets/img/pbio_img/loki.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded-circle" width="25%" height="auto" alt="Loki the Trickster!" align="right" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();">
    This is Loki! She lives up to her name. She mischiefs, she pranks and plays with her brother and sister and on occasion, she has driven me to insanity! But I love her anyway. She's tiny for a cat of her age, but her kitten-like looks just go with her forever-kitten-like personality! She loves to hop up to me in the middle of my working, head bump my face and then hop onto my lap and curl up to sleep. As everyone knows, it is the law to allow a cat to sleep on you. Or face the penalty of claws.

    <h6>Gismo - The soon-to-be King</h6>
    <img src="/assets/img/pbio_img/gismo.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded-circle" width="25%" height="auto" alt="Gismo the REAL King!!" align="right" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();">
    Gismo is the REAL king! Gismo is a chunky boy who <em>loves</em> pets. He loves and wants attention from my fiancé all the time. He loves his belly scratches and once he moves in with me and my cat-kids, he'll definitely claim Arthas' throne as the one true King of the cat colony!
