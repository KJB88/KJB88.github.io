<strong>Words of Wisdom</strong>
<br />
Along our journey, we meet so many different souls. Many of them we may never see again after our first interaction, others become life-long friends and partners, whom we share our entire lives with in one way or another. Friends, colleagues, acquaitances, family, partners, pets. Much like the wonderful world of game physics, every interaction nudges the direction of our life slightly. The good interactions push us with inspiration, happiness and fulfillment. The bad interactions throw us around like a ragdoll, bouncing our life an feelings everywhere. I really hope I never reach Half-Life ragdoll level of emotional turmoil. I like my bones intact, thank you very much.

As you can imagine for anyone who has ever ventured outside their house at least once (honest, it happened!), I've met a whole bunch of people. I consider most of these my friends that I care for very much. In this section, I would like to basically praise them for being the unique, amazing people that they are and describe the impact they've had on me. You should always tell those close to you and those who have had a positive impact how much you genuinely appreciate them. No one gets to hear that enough in their life.

Okay, so I've definitely got to praise my friends or I'll never hear the end of the complaining! Now, I can't cover all of the hundreds of people I call my friends in some capacity, so I'll only go over the closest of the close and those who had the greatest impact on me. Over the decades, I've collected a large menagerie of varied indivduals within the absurd and ridiculous 'Danger Zone' I call my various friendship circles.

<strong>The Muse</strong>
<br />
First, I need to praise my fianc√© of one and a bit years (at the time of writing!). She's been my rock throughout our time together and has helped me to not only understand who I really am underneath the layers of stress-mitigation armour and years of challenges, but to also help me grow as a person for my future. She is incredibly empathic, understanding and so very caring. But she's also incredibly talented and intuitive. A fine artist in her own right, despite her own challenges, she has always stoked my imagination and creativity, pushing me to be more innovative and unorthodox in my approaches to everything I do. She's also incredibly funny, which matches my happy-go-lucky and joking personality. She taught me how to fully enjoy and immerse myself in the things that make me happy and passionate. All of this comes together to define who I am now; a passionate and driven creative with an unshakeable momentum and an unstoppable force of technical aptitude and compassionate leadership.

<strong>The Wordsmith</strong>
<br />
I have a best friend who is a very stalwart, stoic person. Under the layers of unflinching hardiness, lies a truly talented creative with a penchant for wordsmithing. He can spin a fancy yarn out of any old thing. He's been my buddy since I made my first steps into Nursery (I think its the UK's Kindergarten equivalent) when I was around 4 years old. His constant camaraderie has been a comfort for me and spending evenings playing crap games and just having a laugh has got me through many hard times, more than even he might know. We're both getting on in years now but we're still thick as thieves. About as mischievous as well!

<strong>The Genius</strong>
<br />
Another friend of mine is a very talented developer, practically a genius. At this point, he could be a CTO but he prefers the comfortable life of stability and doing what he loves; programming. I made the mistake of comparing myself to him in university, but as the years went on, I realised that its not about comparison, its about inspiration. I took notes of his advice, improving my own approaches and used his incredible talent to inspire me to grow my own.
