<strong>Words of Wisdom</strong>
<br />
Along our journey, we meet so many different souls. Many of them we may never see again after our first interaction, others become life-long friends and partners, whom we share our entire lives with in one way or another. Friends, colleagues, acquaitances, family, partners, pets. Much like the wonderful world of game physics, every interaction nudges the direction of our life slightly. The good interactions push us with inspiration, happiness and fulfillment. The bad interactions throw us around like a ragdoll, bouncing our life an feelings everywhere. I really hope I never reach Half-Life ragdoll level of emotional turmoil. I like my bones intact, thank you very much.

As you can imagine for anyone who has ever ventured outside their house at least once (honest, it happened!), I've met a whole bunch of people. I consider most of these my friends that I care for very much. In this section, I would like to basically praise them for being the unique, amazing people that they are and describe the impact they've had on me. You should always tell those close to you and those who have had a positive impact how much you genuinely appreciate them. No one gets to hear that enough in their life.

Okay, so I've definitely got to praise my friends or I'll never hear the end of the complaining! Now, I can't cover all of the hundreds of people I call my friends in some capacity, so I'll only go over the closest of the close and those who had the greatest impact on me. Over the decades, I've collected a large menagerie of varied indivduals within the absurd and ridiculous 'Danger Zone' I call my various friendship circles.

<strong>The Muse</strong>
<br />
First, I need to praise my fianc√© of one and a bit years (at the time of writing!). She's been my rock throughout our time together and has helped me to not only understand who I really am underneath the layers of stress-mitigation armour and years of challenges, but to also help me grow as a person for my future. She is incredibly empathic, understanding and so very caring. But she's also incredibly talented and intuitive. A fine artist in her own right, despite her own challenges, she has always stoked my imagination and creativity, pushing me to be more innovative and unorthodox in my approaches to everything I do. She's also incredibly funny, which matches my happy-go-lucky and joking personality. She taught me how to fully enjoy and immerse myself in the things that make me happy and passionate. All of this comes together to define who I am now; a passionate and driven creative with an unshakeable momentum and an unstoppable force of technical aptitude and compassionate leadership.

<strong>The Wordsmith</strong>
<br />
I have a best friend who is a very stalwart, stoic person. Under the layers of unflinching hardiness, lies a truly talented creative with a penchant for wordsmithing. He can spin a fancy yarn out of any old thing. He's been my buddy since I made my first steps into Nursery (I think its the UK's Kindergarten equivalent) when I was around 4 years old. His constant camaraderie has been a comfort for me and spending evenings playing crap games and just having a laugh has got me through many hard times, more than even he might know. We're both getting on in years now but we're still thick as thieves. About as mischievous as well!

<strong>The Genius</strong>
<br />
Another friend of mine is a very talented developer, practically a genius. I met him while I was studying at university but at this point, he could be a CTO! But he prefers the comfortable life of stability and doing what he loves; programming. I made the mistake of comparing myself to him in university, but as the years went on, I realised that its not about comparison, its about inspiration. I took notes of his advice, improving my own approaches and used his incredible talent to inspire me to grow my own.

<strong>The Jokester</strong>
<br />
While I was at university, I met another unique individual. He struggled a lot with his confidence when programming (even though his code was great) but he had a huge personality. Always laughing, joking and for some reason; eating. But he kept our spirits up constantly. He's a great guy and is doing really well in his career nowadays! He taught me that no matter what we're doing, where we're doing it or why we're doing it; there's always a bright-side or a chance for you to raise the spirits of others nearby. It took me awhile to appreciate this, but I owe it to this bloke for that lesson.

<strong>The Leader</strong>
<br />
Later in my career, I met a true exemplar for real leadership. He wasn't just a 'boss', he was a supportive friend, compassion colleague and amazing person in general. He taught me what it REALLY meant to be a leader. That its a responsibility for people, not 'a team' or 'the business'. He always adopted a supportive role, facilitating whatever tools we needed to get our job done, no matter the task at hand or working environment. But he also knew we were human. We all had our own personal struggles, me especially, and he always treated me like a human first, employee second. No matter the issue, he was there to support me through it, regardless of what the business stated was to happen in that situation. I learned a lot about leadership from this guy and he instilled within me one of my core values that I carry to this day.

<strong>The Family</strong>
<br />
Naturally I have to thank my family too! My parents for ripping me from the ocean of souls and imprisoning me in this mortal cage made of meat. But also, for gifting me the drive, passion and creativity that empowers my every action and decision in life. My siblings, 3 brothers and a sister, for their endless support and encouragement throughout my life, even when I wasn't the best older brother to them. Especially my late brother, who despite leaving us far too early, still inspires me to this day to help and support as many people as possible through this awful mental health crisis.
