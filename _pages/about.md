TECHNICAL:
I'm a ~10 year veteran of Unity Development. Straight out of my undergrad, I hit the ground running by creating rapid prototypes for showcase pieces for the University's own Logistics Institute. I was personally headhunted by a
multi-national manufacturer to design and develop their next generation digital software and to handle hiring the talent to get the job done. Within 3 years of graduation, I was the technical lead of an innovative simulation project, with a hand-built/cherry-picked team, workflow
and tech-stack, all achieved by my own hands. My team and I successfully delivered ongoing major releases of the project, based on my initial pitch and designs; adjusted and scoped for the business's requirements. I always strive to excel at within my role as a developer and as leader. I love and seek out technical challenges and always overcome hurdles to become a better leader.

PROFESSIONAL VALUES:
With my 10 years of experience, I am confident and assertive about my beliefs within my profession. I bring Mental Health Awareness and Wellbeing to the forefront of company considerations. I drive passionately for reform in business for Disability Rights in the Workplace. And I try to empower others to be compassionate, kind and open leaders and to always remind others that everyone is a human-first, employee-second. My approaches and outspoken nature provide a platform to empower my team(s) to do their best work, fully supported and cared for as professionals and as humans.

Below are my professional contact options. Please feel free to reach out for anything.
