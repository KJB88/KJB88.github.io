    <strong>My Core Values</strong>
    <br>
    During my brief ~36 years in this mortal coil, I have met amazing and not-so-amazing people, I have had great experiences and negative experiences. I have learned many lessons through pain and through success. All of these have influenced how I choose to live my life. I have three key values that I assertively apply everywhere I can. I try to spread the message as progressively and as far-reaching as I possibly can. But I'm happy if I can change the situation for even one person.

    <strong>Mental Health Awareness & Well-Being</strong>
    <br>
    I have had my own mental health struggles over the years. Battling for as long as I can remember against undiagnosed ADHD. The spiral into depression because of that and the constant anxiety that I couldn't keep up with others without putting in 150% more effort. Now that I understand my unique brain and it's limitations, I decided to stand up as an advocate for Mental Health Awareness and especially Well-Being. I not only spread awareness of these topics wherever I go, I also advocate loudly within the companies I work for to ensure that we're supporting, empowering and compassionately handling professionals who suffer from these awful illnesses. The state of the world right now is a Mental Health Crisis and I will always stand up and do my part to help support those in need. No one deserves to feel lost and alone and no one deserves to feel the loss of a loved one because of it.

    <strong>Disability Rights (also in the Workplace)</strong>
    <br>
    As a sufferer of MADD, ADHD and Crohn's Disease, I have a fair amount of experience dealing with the negatives of disabilities. Unmanaged and unmedicated, these illnesses would destroy my life completely. Even managed and medicated, they still make a negative impact on my day-to-day, but we're talking about a difference of 2% vs 98%. Unfortunately, many people and businesses don't fully understand the severity of these challenges faced by workers with disabilities. 'Reasonable Adjustments' are often not sufficient to support an employee to produce their best work. I stand up and advocate for improvements to policy; particularly, sickness and absence policy, remote/hybrid working and flexibility in hours. Supporting and allowing a worker to define their own work environment enables them to optimise it for their own unique personal challenges so they can take them out of the equation and focus purely on adding value to your business. Remember, equity not equals. We have to support those with disabilities who face unique challenges and help to raise them up and empower them. Not slap them with the "It works for everyone else." policy.

    <strong>Compassionate Leadership</strong>
    <br>
    I'm a human. You're a human (hopefully). We're all humans. No matter our title, our salary, our challenges or our attitude - we're all human in the end. I advocate that real leaders are there to support, facilitate and help their team(s) beyond just a professional/business duty. We have a duty to look after our people on a personal level too. This ties in to my other beliefs. A real leader doesn't demand better output and quote policy, they ask, "Why has this happened and how can we fix it together?". A real leader uses discretion to ensure that an employee has more good days than bad days; and when the bad days hit, workload, scheduling and environment can be adjusted to support that employee in their unique challenges. There is no 'blanket' workflow. There are only workflows that work for individuals and those that do not. When you have the opportunity to support another human, we should always seek to do so. That "Take the rest of the day off, don't worry." or "No problem, work remotely for today and let me know how you feel tomorrow." could save a life.
