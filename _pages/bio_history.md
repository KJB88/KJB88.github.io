It's time for A Brief History of Kev! \*jazz hands\*

I'm a Yorkshire lad, born in the maritime city of Hull. From a very early age, I was into video games. One of my earliest memories
is playing Sonic 3 (& Knuckles!) 8 hours a day, every day. My dad introduced me to the wider world of PC precursor systems: the
Commodore 64 then Amiga 1200. I grew up playing the likes of Beach Head, Elite, Syndicate, UFO: Enemy Unknown and Cannon Fodder. Simpler times, for sure.

Now I spend my time split between my hobbies - reading, creative writing, gaming, petting cats and learning the violin.
