<strong>Awareness & Understanding</strong>
<br />
This section might seem weirdly personal, but I'm an open book about these subjects. Awareness is the key to understanding. This understanding cures ignorance and creates a compassionate and open environment for us to discuss and find solutions to treat, manage, support people with and ultimately, remove these horrible conditions from our society. I want to highlight some of the challenges, effects pre- and post-medication/treatment and the impact these have had on my life. I hope these short paragraphs of my own experiences with these illnesses can help to highlight the difficulty that people with disabilities can face on a daily basis. Time to discuss my three major health hurdles: Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder (MADD), combined Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Crohn's Disease (that's Mr Crohns to you!).

<strong>Crohn's Disease</strong>
<br />
So, Crohn's Disease. My life-long partner through life. It's an autoimmune disease that makes your own immune system attack your gastrointestinal (GI) tract, very often triggered by eating regular food. Usually impacting the lower GI tract like the intestines, it can cause massive inflammation in there, causing significant pain and discomfort. Not to mention the other very unfun symptoms like requiring the loo frequently (to put it politely), constant fatigue and exhaustion, inability to sleep and malnutrition. Now, malnutrition might not sound like a big deal, but having it from a young age means that your body doesn't have enough useful materials to grow properly. Your brain will hog most of it first and the rest of you gets the scraps. If those scraps aren't enough, you'll end up with abnormalities in growth such as weaker bones, smaller body frame, etc. These 'side effects' will spawn additional issues.
</p>
<p>
I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease at 5, but my parents struggled to feed me since birth. I'd refuse to eat and cry often due to pain. This means that doctors think I've had it since birth. I've already covered some of its impact in my Origin Story section. But growing up, I never had the energy to do much. I wasn't able to eat much of anything and when I found something that minimised my suffering after eating, I'd simply just eat that all the time. After my operation and all the complications were handled (thanks NHS!), I was finally able to make a start on my life properly but it had irreparably damaged my childhood and social life to the point where I was socially anxious. I had been forced to live a sheltered life due to it and wasn't as 'worldly' as my peers.
</p>
<p>
Now as an adult, I still get regualar discomfort and I definitely need the loo a lot, but its managed and its been in what my Consultant Gastroenterologist calls 'remission'. As in, the majority of extreme symptoms are currently gone. There is always the possibility of a 'flare-up', which could put me in a very bad place health-wise, but I won't fear for my future because a disability. I consider my diet very carefully, ensuring that I avoid eating anything with my known discomfort 'triggers' in my food. I still have bad days where getting off the toilet for longer than 20minutes is impossible, but with the adoption of remote working as a regular approach by companies, I no longer have to worry about a CODE: BROWN emergency happening on my commute or being very late because I couldn't get off the loo.

<strong>Combined Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</strong>
<br />
ADHD is hard to explain. Many people think it's a fidgeting, loud or disruptive child, but that's only a small part of it. Many ADHD sufferers don't display the hyperactivity portion or display it in very muted ways. ADHD has two components to it: Inattentive (this is the AD part of the ADHD) and Hyperactive-Impulsive (this is the H part of it). You can have one or the other, or both as a combined presentation. There's so many symptoms that differ across sufferers in both presence and severity that I don't even know where to start. Oh, actually, let's just go through how it affected me!
</p>
<p>
I was diagnosed with combined ADHD in November 2023. Not too long ago from me writing this. Prior to that, all throughout my life, I struggled with many things I thought were just how I was as a person. Now, let me preface this by saying that within my professional life, the momentum I kept drove me to develop coping mechanisms so the impact in my worklife was mitigated. But within my personal life, I was never able to complete any of my own personal goals. I thought that I was simply a career person and accomplishing my dreams outside of that were simply not feasible for a person like me. I could sit down in front of my workstation, have the time, money, energy, desire, plans and tools to make a game, but I couldn't. Not because I didn't know how, I've dedicated my professional life to games technology, but my brain just wouldn't 'go'. It's hard to explain, but this is one of the most severe and debilitating symptoms; Executive Dysfunction. Anyone who has never had to suffer with this would find it hard to believe. You want or need and are fully capable of doing something, but <b>can't</b>. My brain just wouldn't do it. Other fun symptoms are (but are not limited to) none-stop racing thoughts, obsession on a single thought, inability to follow societal norms/cues, dopamine-seeking behavior like rapid context-switching, easily distracted, inability to focus.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after my diagnosis and tests to ensure I was compatible with any medications, I began the treatment regime of stimulants. At first, it only seemed to slow my thoughts slightly. It was nice to experience that literal 'peace of mind', but my Executive Dysfunction and inability to maintain focus was my major hurdles. My psychiatrist and I agreed that an aggressive approach in increasing my dosage would be the best option. It wasn't until mid-January 2024 that I reached a dose where my brain stopped fighting me and started supporting me! It's hard to describe the change. I went from struggling to get even the smallest thing done in my personal life to sitting down and working 12+ hours a day without realising. I went from lacking motivation to do chores, shopping or even go outside to being incredibly outgoing, sociable and assertive. The pills didn't change my personality so to say, rather it allowed me to be <em>more</em> <b>ME</b>! Now I'm driven, passionate, unyielding and empowered. My love for learning, my hobbies, my craft and the people in my life all came back almost overnight on this dose. I was finally able to live my life how I wanted to live, not just in the directions my brain smelled dopamine.

<strong>Anxiety</strong>
<br />
Everyone has anxiety. But people with clinical anxiety have far too much of it. It impacts being able to take action easily. A person may overthink to the point of breakdown or they might overthink to the point that they convince themselves they can't do the action or try to avoid the action. This can even happen with simple, daily tasks like washing the dishes or cleaning the house. This results in missing opportunities in life, not living life to the fullest and becoming isolated and sheltered from the world due to fear.
</p>
<p>
I was diagnosed with MADD probably around 2020. So I haven't really had treatment and management for it very long. But as far back as I can remember, I've always struggled with fear of doing the unknown or being able to handle every situation. My imposter syndrome voice was <b>very</b> loud throughout my life. I remember passing my driving test and having the freedom to go anywhere right in front of me, but my anxiety wouldn't let me drive, even though I was fully qualified. For my professional life, I pushed through as best I could, knowing that academic and business duties were very well defined really helped. Everything was tightly controlled, but I spent a lot of my adult life dealing with that fear and missing out on a lot of experiences.
</p>
<p>
Prior to my ADHD medication, I was on an anti-depressant medication. This didn't really help with my depression but it basically cured my anxiety. It was very freeing to not second guess everything I decided or wanted to do. But I still felt hurdles in my mental health. I wasn't able to motivate outside of work and I didn't feel that passion for my hobbies or my relationships. But without my anxiety pills, I was wrecked with social and general anxiety, overthinking and analysis paralysis. I still didn't feel like me, but I struggled on thinking that this was the normal for me.

<strong>Depression</strong>
<br />
Depression is a sinister condition. It sucks the joy out of your life. It hides your passion, desires and happiness under a thick black blanket that is far too heavy to lift right now. You find no enjoyment in your hobbies, your social life or your work anymore. You struggle to find the motivation to even get out of bed. It makes you question your worth as a professional, as a friend/partner and most worryingly, your worth as a person. This is what can drive people over the edge where we lose them forever.
</p>
<p>
I don't know how long I've had depression. I was often moving so fast through life, I never really got to sit down and consider what I truly, deeply enjoyed in life. I know I loved gaming, but I didn't realize that the joy I experienced was a very shallow joy because I didn't know any better! The condition conspires against you to make you think this is how it should feel; this empty, hollow low quality insult to what real joy should be. But it doesn't have to be like that.
</p>
<p>
When I finally got a diagnosis for ADHD, got medicated and I approached that perfect dosage, I started to feel the desire to do my hobbies (it's why this portfolio site exists now!), to truly enjoy things in life and my passion sparked back to life to be creative and make people smile and laugh. Before that depression was persistent. It refuse to leave me alone completely, even when life was doing great. I had tried therapy and medication and nothing worked. I guess I finally got rid of the symptom of depression when I handled the condition that was causing it; ADHD.
