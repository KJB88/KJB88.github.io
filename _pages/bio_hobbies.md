<strong>Overview</strong>
<br />
So under this professional guise I put forth into the world, I have a mishmash of other interests that I enjoy at least semi-regularly. Naturally, I enjoy programming and gaming. It's why I got into games development in the first place! I also enjoy world building, which I do through my creative writing. I enjoy reading for that same reason! And there are a couple of others that I have been working on steadily but I'm still not great at.

<p>
<strong>Programming</strong>
<br />
I absolutely love programming. And I especially love games programming. My day jobs have usually eaten up all of my daily programming capacity, but I recently find myself with more energy and time to work on my own stuff! So I've been digging out old projects across my talents and seeing what could use a good dusting off! My partner and I are also working on a tiny indie game together, to see how far we get! I love talking about code. I love talking about designs and I love doing both.

<strong>Gaming</strong>
<br />
I've been an avid gamer ever since I was about 4 years old. I have kept this passion and interest throughout my life, amassing a library of over 850+ games on my Steam account. If I factor in all the games I've bought for other platforms, we're well over 1000+. I love story-heavy games like RPGs but I also love the tension and planning for first-persion survival and/or extraction shooters. For me, it's not all about fun; its also about what a game makes me feel and I love it when they make me feel immersed.

<strong>Creative Writing</strong>
<br />
Oh boy, this is a big one for me. When the inspiration and passion strikes me, I can write until its 4am and not even realise. I have an Epic of over 100k+ words all about a space marine punching space clowns. In space. I love parody, satire, comedy and absurdism. I was inspired as a young lad and fledgling writer by the great comedy geniuses of Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams. Able to tell a humorous story without detracting from the depth of the world and characters. They bring everything together into a kind of 'grounded ridiculousness' that I put a lot of effort to repeat through their inspiration.
