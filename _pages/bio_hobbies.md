<strong>Overview</strong>
<br />
So under this professional guise I put forth into the world, I have a mishmash of other interests that I enjoy at least semi-regularly. Naturally, I enjoy programming and gaming. It's why I got into games development in the first place! I also enjoy world building, which I do through my creative writing. I enjoy reading for that same reason! And there are a couple of others that I have been working on steadily but I'm still not great at.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Programming</strong>
<br />
I absolutely love programming. And I especially love games programming. My day jobs have usually eaten up all of my daily programming capacity, but I recently find myself with more energy and time to work on my own stuff! So I've been digging out old projects across my talents and seeing what could use a good dusting off! My partner and I are also working on a tiny indie game together, to see how far we get! I love talking about code. I love talking about designs and I love doing both.

<strong>Gaming</strong>
<br />
I've been an avid gamer ever since I was about 4 years old. I have kept this passion and interest throughout my life, amassing a library of over 850+ games on my Steam account. If I factor in all the games I've bought for other platforms, we're well over 1000+. I love story-heavy games like RPGs but I also love the tension and planning for first-persion survival and/or extraction shooters. For me, it's not all about fun; its also about what a game makes me feel and I love it when they make me feel immersed.

<strong>Creative Writing</strong>
<br />
Oh boy, this is a big one for me. When the inspiration and passion strikes me, I can write until its 4am and not even realise. I have an Epic of over 100k+ words all about a space marine punching space clowns. In space. I love parody, satire, comedy and absurdism. I was inspired as a young lad and fledgling writer by the great comedy geniuses of Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams. Able to tell a humorous story without detracting from the depth of the world and characters. They bring everything together into a kind of 'grounded ridiculousness' that I put a lot of effort to repeat through their inspiration. My favourite settings are High Fantasy, Science-Fiction and Modern Day - but I turn them into absurdist parodies of themselves. It's quite fun actually!

<strong>Reading</strong>
<br />
I love reading as a way to wind-down in the evenings. From Shorts to Epics, I love them all. Whether its Stephen King's <em>The Jaunt</em> to Tolkien's legendary <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, Orwell's classic <em>1984</em> to Pratchett's hysterical <em>The Colour of Magic</em>, I love them all! I have such a massive backlog of fiction to read that at this point, I don't think I'll ever manage to read them all!

<strong>Violin</strong>
<br />
Now, let me preface this by saying I have never had any musical aptitude. My natural gift was always science, not the arts! But the Violin is an incredibly beautiful instruement, each draw of the bow across the strings pulls at my heartstrings. So I endeavoured to learn how to produce such beautiful sounds from it! Inbetween my other hobbies and lack of time during working over the years, this hobby of mine has laid dormant for far too long. When circumstances permit, I will definitely be picking up lessons from a professional!

<strong>Languages</strong>
<br />
When someone asks me what languages I know, my first instinct is always to list off my programming languages. That should give you some inkling as to how varied my human linguistics are - the answer is not at all. I know one language fluently and it's English. Because I'm a UK national. I decided to learn German as my fianc√© is German and I think it's the least I could do is to learn her native language. Not just out of consideration for her and her family, but also so that I can enjoy my visits to Germany more naturally by speaking to people in their own native tongue (if they want to, of course!).
