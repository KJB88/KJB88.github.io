Well, I'm Kevin! A thirty-something Unity developer. You've seen the tecnical shpiel. 10 year veteran, yada yada.
We all know you're here to see my cats. But you'll have to wait a bit longer!

I'm an easy-going guy. I prefer to be laid-back and take a human-focuse approach to everything I do. We're all humans doing stuff
for other humans, right? I live and work while embodying my beliefs that everyone deserves compassion and respect. I infuse that into
my hobbies and professional life, ensuring that my actions cause no harm.

Over the years I've met a lot of people who taught me valuable lessons
