A thirty-something ADHD fella, struggling with sparse facial hair. You'll find me somewhere under a pile of cats! My partner-in-crime is a very tall German lady who is my inspiration, my muse and my emotional coach through life. <br> Like a typical human being, there's a lot to me. I'm driven, passionate, free-spirited and confident. I have a strong set of core values I adhere to, no matter where or what I'm doing in life. I have a few hobbies; trying (and failing) to learn the violin, creative writing, reading, hobbyist games dev, petting cats and gaming. One of those 'hobbies' cutely insists on a lot more attention than the others. Can you guess which one? <br> I suffer with a few select items of poor genetics! Crohn's Disease, ADHD and MADD. Because of these disabilities, I'm a vocal advocate for Mental Health Awareness and Wellbeing, Disability Rights in the Workplace and a 'Human-First, Employee-Second' approach to Leadership. I believe in Trust, Integrity, Compassion and Support. We're all humans, so let's all treat each other like humans first and foremost. I'll get my protest board out and give you the lecture later! <br> I won't get too deep into my professional life, but I've been working with Unity and C# for a decade. Straight out of university, basically. Ahhh, what a fresh-faced young developer I was! I do enjoy some personal programming with other tools though. I made a Discord Bot to annoy my friends, plenty of MonoGame/XNA stuff in the past. I'm trying my luck with Godot and Unreal Engine. And I really miss my time working at a very low-level with C++. It might be time to get back on that too! <br> You can find information below about my values, my hobbies, my background and, of course, my cats! Well, if you're interested that is! </details> </div> <hr> <div class="profile float-left"> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <details><summary><strong>BACKGROUND</strong> - It's time for 'A Brief History of Kev'! \*<em>jazz hands</em>\* </summary> <br> I'm an East Yorkshire lad, born in the maritime city of Hull in the UK. From a very early age, I was into video games. One of my earliest memories is playing Sonic 3 (&amp; Knuckles!) upwards of 8 hours a day, every day. My dad introduced me to the wider world of PC precursor systems: the Commodore 64 then the Amiga 1200. I grew up playing the likes of Beach Head, Elite then Syndicate, UFO: Enemy Unknown and Cannon Fodder. Nothing like defending Earth from the Alien menace to really inspire a young mind! <br> As I grew up, the question of where games actually came from started to form in my the space between my ears. During my tween years, I tried my best to figure it out. But a council estate lad who lives off microwave chips and dinosaur nuggies doesn't merely stumble across a Brackey's games development tutorial during the late nineties and early naughties. I did, however, stumble across random development applications like RPGMaker, a small private server community for an early naughties online MMO called Graal Online. These exploratory options <br> It was around this time I had a major hurdle in my life. My Crohn's disease, a rather grumpy and inconsiderate partner-slash-condition I had been carrying around since birth, decided it'd had enough of my gluttonous love for turkey dinosaurs and soggy potatoes and came for revenge. Homestuck due to the pain, exhaustion and 'less fun' symptoms, I spent my time playing PSX and N64 games with infrequent home-education provided by my school. I eventually had a major operation which REALLY helped, but lots of complications during recovery. I think I missed the entire final 4 years of secondary school education. I still sat my GCSES; 2 Cs and 2 Ds for the core subjects. Not bad for someone who barely studied for 4 years! <br> Anyway, onto a slightly better time after that! With my health somewhat improved and free from the shackles of mandatory education; I went into optional education instead! To the realms of Sixth Form College I go! I met a lot of good friends here, peers who are out in the world now making a change. I studied the only IT / CompSci relevant subject available; 'IT Practitioners', both as a 'First Diploma' and a 'National Diploma', whatever those are. After that, I decided that education wasn't for me right now and had that whole 'find your purpose in life' phase. <br> Now we skip over a large portion of my life which I have aptly named the 'Blunder Years'. Because it was just me blundering around, making mistakes and trying to find a purpose in life. Instead, I found Mixed Depression and Anxiety Disorder and I can't find anyone to buy it off me so I'm stuck with it. This must be why they say impulse purchases are bad. <br> In my late twenties, I decided to give university life a shot. I'd tried everything else, may as well get into a few tens of thousand quid worth of debt. I hesitantly and anxiously applied for the BSc in Computer Science with Games Development at the University of Hull. And I was accepted! With a conditional of doing the Foundation Year. Works for me! I took to it like a duck to a dinner plate. I grew both academically and personally, I met great colleagues, friends and peers. I learned an incredible amount of knowledge and put in 150% wherever I could. It felt like I was born for programming and learning. I graduated with a First Class because of all the momentum and drive I had. <br> I got my first real programming job here too! I worked in academia as a Unity developer for the Business School at the University of Hull. Another graduate and I worked on contracts and showcase pieces that the University felt would highlight their cutting-edge immersive tech. At that point it was the Oculus Rift, Microsoft HoloLens and things like Digital Twin simulation. Very cool stuff for a fresh grad to work on and very fast paced! <br> At the same time I tried to complete my MSc Comp Sci &amp; Games Dev post-grad. Big mistake! Working full time, studying full time and dealing with other personal issues simultaneously was impossible. I managed to complete about 75% of my post-grad with a whole lot of stress when something exceptional arrived... (it wasn't me. I was already there!). <br> I was personally headhunted by a global client with whom I worked closely during my work with the University. They reached out to hire me for a very ambitious project and wanted me to design it <em>from scratch</em> AND <em>build a team to deliver it</em>. I couldn't say no as a graduate with only a year and bit of work under my belt. I dropped out of my MSc (I'll come back to you one day, I promise!) and shifted jobs. </details> </div> </article> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Kevin Barr.
