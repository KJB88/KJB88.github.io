<h2><u>Short Version</u></h2>
I was personally headhunted by the Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) Hull Plant to join their new Digitalisation Department as a Digitalisation Specialist (original title was Factory Simulation Expert). I was hired to design and develop a solution utilizing Unity (games tech.) to meet their evolving business demands in the new age of real-time graphics and data visualization. Throughout my time there, I primarily developed their in-house simulation software. I started with designing and building a proof-of-concept. Upon sign off of this deliverable, the main project was underway. I interviewed, hired and built a team of talented developers to begin full development. During this time, I was in a Lead/Senior Digitalisation Specialist role, leading and supporting my team as well as being hands-on with the technical implementation. Throughout the development lifecycle, I was handling day-to-day leadership duties, project management and working with partners (and other departments) to build a content pipeline and management system to optimize and better facilitate how we pipe in assets and data into the simulation.

<h5>Responsibilities</h5>
<ul>
<li>Primary Systems Architect for Large Scalable System.</li>
<li>Core Unity/C# Developer throughout lifecycle</li>
<li>Technical Leadership for small team of Unity Developers.</li>
<li>Implement initial Project Management suite and Tech-Stack.</li>
<li>Educate the company on the usage of the technology and project as well as advocate for how it can further meet business requirements and improve industrial processes.
<li>Co-operate and Liaise with SMEs, internal and external partners to faciliate development of the project.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Challenges</h5>
<ul>
<li>Designing a large yet scalable commercial solution with only 1.5years experience in development.</li>
<li>Taking on a Leadership role with no prior experience.</li>
<li>Managing a software project (and its supporting stack) with no prior professional experience.</li>
<li>Operating within a Manufacturing Facility that doesn't have specific Software Protocols/Environments.</li>
<li>Facilitating a Co-operative approach between other business units/entities that have their own timelines.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Actions</h5>
<ul>
<li>Designing: Approached requirements cautiously and clarified any and all ambiguity. Designed solution with modularity as primary concern. Performed research on and off work-hours to ensure best approaches. Regularly consulted relevant SMEs to ensure accuracy.</li>
<li>Leadership: Sought out advice from other proven leaders in my professional career. Regularly reflected on my decisions with a business-lens and a human-focused lens. Reached out to my line manager regarding leadership education and training.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Results</h5>
<ul>
<li>Designing: Developed a solid foundation that could scale, evolve and adapt as required. Used as the basis to build further systems on top. Extra time with SMEs was time well-spent when a high-value business decision was made based on a difference of centimeters in-sim.</li>
<li>Leadership: Utilising a human-first, employee-second approach made me approachable and open for my team and confident and assertive when dealing with business. I was able to provide working environments for my team that facilitated them doing their best work.</li>
<li>Managing: Chosen software met the business, project and team use cases. Facilitating accurate workload estimation and good output with little busywork/paperwork. On-site hardware provided safe and secure storage for code repositories.</li>
<li>Operating: Guidelines ensured consistent approaches throughout project. Educational training on AGILE to business made business adopt these approaches across the site, with adjustments. This facilitated high-level visibility of blockers which previously had an significant impact on the business.</li>
<li>Partners: Partners enjoyed working with me. With their co-operation, was able to implement a strong and reliable pipeline for content and data, with reduced busywork/paperwork on their end. Their feedback helped to reach an optimal balance between departments.</li>
