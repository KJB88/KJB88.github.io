  <h5>Introduction</h5>
  <p>
    I was personally headhunted by a multi-national energy company to join their new simulation department as a specialist in Unity. I was hired to design and develop a solution utilizing Unity (games tech.) to meet their evolving business demands in the new age of real-time graphics and data visualization. Throughout my time there, I primarily developed their in-house simulation software. I started with designing and building a proof-of-concept. Upon sign off of this deliverable, the main project was underway. I interviewed, hired and built a team of talented developers to begin full development. During this time, I was in a Lead/Senior Developer role, leading and supporting my team as well as being hands-on with the technical implementation. Throughout the development lifecycle, I was handling day-to-day leadership duties, project management and working with partners (and other departments) to build a content pipeline and management system to optimize and better facilitate how we pipe in assets and data into the simulation.

  <h5>The Project</h5>
  <p>
    The Project itself was innovative and revolutionary for the company. It was to provide a whole-new interactive and visual way to visualize data. Using data pulled from various departments, specialist sensing hardware, factory PLCs and ground-crew reporting, the simulation would provide a top-level overview of a facility. The ability to tune down the scope to visualize elements at a micro level granted great freedom to decision makers on where, when and how processes could be optimised. This also allowed for predicting delays, sandboxing hypothetical contingencies and war-gaming unfavourable scenarios without impacting the site's output. All of this was done in Unity - a games development engine.

  <h5>Actions</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Designing:</b> Approached requirements cautiously and clarified any and all ambiguity. Designed solution with modularity as primary concern. Performed research on and off work-hours to ensure best approaches. Regularly consulted relevant SMEs to ensure accuracy.</li>
    <li><b>Leadership:</b> Sought out advice from other proven leaders in my professional career. Regularly reflected on my decisions with a business-lens and a human-focused lens. Reached out to my line manager regarding leadership education and training.</li>
    <li><b>Managing:</b> Researched in detail the pros and cons of software and technologies. Assessed relevance to business and project. Worked closely with IT & Acquisitions to support purchasing hardware/licenses and getting software authorised within the IT ecosystem.</li>
    <li><b>Operating:</b> Implemented programming/usage guidelines, instructed on AGILE methodologies and when/how to expect milestones, deliveries and cadence of meetings with relevant parties.</li>
    <li><b>Partners:</b> Provided extreme flexibility to meet partners within their own schedules. Clearly and concisely communicated intention and expectations for the project and how we can develop an improved process. Reached out for feedback regularly on how the pipeline was performing.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  <h5>Results</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Designing:</b> Developed a solid foundation that could scale, evolve and adapt as required. Used as the basis to build further systems on top. Extra time with SMEs was time well-spent when a high-value business decision was made based on a difference of centimeters in-sim.</li>
    <li><b>Leadership:</b> Utilising a human-first, employee-second approach made me approachable and open for my team and confident and assertive when dealing with business. I was able to provide working environments for my team that enabled them to do their best work.</li>

      <h5>Retrospective</h5>
      <p>
      This role was really my awakening as a professional, as a leader and as a developer. Prior to this, I had worked in a rather informal setting as a contractor with work being rather ad-hoc and on-demand mostly. But within this role, I was thrust into leadership and given near-complete autonomy for designing the application from the ground up. I had to quickly hit the ground running and do my best. I relied on many leaders that I had met at that point in my life, as well as my direct line manager to understand proper approaches, company red-tape and how to get 'things done' reliably and quickly. I realized that there was a great many things that a technical leader with no prior experience doesn't know and so I did my best to seek out what I needed to do my job as efficiently as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, this was not without hurdles. I had handled gathering and analyzing client requirements before, but the sheer list of what the company needed was staggering. It was just me initially, as a lone developer, designing and developing what would be a game-changer for the company from the list of requirements I was holding in my hand. I had to design it all out on a large whiteboard I had in the office just to really understand the scope of the application and how I could slice it into deliverables. That whiteboard went through quite a few iterations before I was satisfied. I spent a long time in this phase, going back and forth to clarify requirements further and then redesigning based on that. But this iterative and determined approached got the initial design and requirements locked down tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      My crash course into Leadership was also fraught with pitfalls. I initially struggled to have the confidence and assertiveness required to tell the company what I needed, rather I was more inclined to accept what they were willing to give me. Obviously, that is a recipe for disaster, as not having the resources for the project would be incredibly damaging to our timeline. However, after reaching out and speaking to other leaders, I learned the best way to present myself and put on my 'professional face'. This ensured that a suitable compromise could be made between the project and the cost to the business and created a confidence in the leadership that I could produce meaningful value for the business. Another issue was that I had no idea of the required work to manage and lead a team. I had to quickly learn on-the-job as issues with workflow and teamworking presented themselves. I had already set up project management tooling which helped immensely to mitigate delays caused by these issues and the laser-focused modular approach to building the system ensured that any issues relating to the project itself were discrete within indivdual Features.
