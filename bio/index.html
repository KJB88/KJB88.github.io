You ready for the story of Kev yet? </div> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p> <br> <strong>Speedrun of Me. Any%</strong> <br> Hi, I'm Kev! A thirty-something ADHD fella, struggling with sparse facial hair. You'll find me somewhere under a pile of cats! My partner-in-crime is a very tall German lady who is my inspiration, my muse and my emotional coach through life. </p> <p> Like a typical human being, there's a lot to me. I'm driven, passionate, free-spirited and confident. I have a strong set of core values I adhere to, no matter where or what I'm doing in life. I have a few hobbies; trying (and failing) to learn the violin, creative writing, reading, hobbyist games dev, petting cats and gaming. One of those 'hobbies' cutely insists on a lot more attention than the others. Can you guess which one? </p> <p> <strong>Speedrun of Me. A Good Try, but not a World Record</strong> <br> I suffer with a few select items of poor genetics! Crohn's Disease, combined ADHD and MADD. Because of these disabilities, I'm a vocal advocate for Mental Health Awareness and Wellbeing, Disability Rights in the Workplace and a 'Human-First, Employee-Second' approach to Leadership. I believe in Trust, Integrity, Compassion and Support. We're all humans, so let's all treat each other like humans first and foremost. I'll get my protest board out and give you the lecture later! </p> <p> <strong>Speedrun of Me. Tool-Assisted Speedrun</strong> <br> I won't get too deep into my professional life, but I've been working with Unity and C# for a decade. Straight out of university, basically. Ahhh, what a fresh-faced young developer I was! I do enjoy some personal programming with other tools though. I made a Discord Bot to annoy my friends, plenty of MonoGame/XNA stuff in the past. I'm trying my luck with Godot and Unreal Engine. And I really miss my time working at a very low-level with C++. It might be time to get back on that too! </p> <p> You can find information below about my values, my hobbies, my background and, of course, my cats! Well, if you're interested that is! </p> </div> </details> <hr> <details> <summary> <strong>Origin Story</strong> - It's time for 'A Brief History of Kev'! *<em>jazz hands</em>* </summary> <div class="profile float-left"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/brief_history_of_kev-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/brief_history_of_kev-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/brief_history_of_kev-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="(min-width: 800px) 231.0px, (min-width: 576px) 30vw, 95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/brief_history_of_kev.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded-circle" width="100%" height="auto" alt="brief_history_of_kev.jpg" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> <div class="more-info"> It's a real picture! Honest. I swear. </div> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p> <br> <strong>Youth &amp; Curiosity</strong> <br> I'm an East Yorkshire lad, born in the maritime city of Hull in the UK. From a very early age, I was into video games. One of my earliest memories is playing Sonic 3 (&amp; Knuckles!) upwards of 8 hours a day, every day. My dad introduced me to the wider world of PC precursor systems: the Commodore 64 then the Amiga 1200. I grew up playing the likes of Beach Head, Elite then Syndicate, UFO: Enemy Unknown and Cannon Fodder. Nothing like defending Earth from the Alien menace to really inspire a young mind! </p> <p> As I grew up, the question of where games actually came from started to form in my the space between my ears. During my tween years, I tried my best to figure it out. But a council estate lad who lives off microwave chips and dinosaur nuggies doesn't merely stumble across a Brackey's games development tutorial during the late nineties and early naughties. I did, however, stumble across random development applications like RPGMaker, a small private server community for an early naughties online MMO called Graal Online. These exploratory options </p> <p> <strong>Biology &amp; Freedom</strong> <br> It was around this time I had a major hurdle in my life. My Crohn's disease, a rather grumpy and inconsiderate partner-slash-condition I had been carrying around since birth, decided it'd had enough of my gluttonous love for turkey dinosaurs and soggy potatoes and came for revenge. Home-stuck due to the pain, exhaustion and 'less fun' symptoms, I spent my time playing PSX and N64 games with infrequent home-education provided by my school. I eventually had a major operation called an intestinal bisection, which just sounds like someone went in there with a pair of scissors. This really helped, but caused lots of complications during recovery. I think I missed the entire final 4 years of secondary school education. I still sat my GCSES; 2 Cs and 2 Ds for the core subjects. Not bad for someone who barely studied for almost the entirety of secondary school! </p> <p> Anyway, onto a slightly better time after that! With my health somewhat improved and free from the shackles of mandatory education; I went into optional education instead! To the realms of Sixth Form College I go! I met a lot of good friends here, peers who are out in the world now making a change. I studied the only IT / Comp-Sci relevant subject available; 'IT Practitioners', both as a 'First Diploma' and a 'National Diploma', whatever those are. After that, I decided that education wasn't for me right now and had that whole 'find your purpose in life' phase. </p> <p> Now we skip over a large portion of my life which I have aptly named the 'Blunder Years'. Because it was just me blundering around, making mistakes and trying to find a purpose in life. Instead, I found Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder (MADD) and I can't find anyone to buy it off me so I'm stuck with it. This must be why they say impulse purchases are bad. </p> <p> <strong>Velocity &amp; Passion</strong> <br> In my late twenties, I decided to give university life a shot. I'd tried everything else, may as well get into a few tens of thousand quid worth of debt. I hesitantly and anxiously applied for the BSc in Computer Science with Games Development at the University of Hull. And I was accepted! With a conditional of doing the Foundation Year. Works for me! I took to it like a duck to a dinner plate. I grew both academically and personally, I met great colleagues, friends and peers. I learned an incredible amount of knowledge and put in 150% wherever I could. It felt like I was born for programming and learning. I graduated with a First Class because of all the momentum and drive I had. </p> <p> I got my first real programming job here too! I worked in academia as a Unity developer for the Business School at the University of Hull. Another graduate and I worked on contracts and showcase pieces that the University felt would highlight their cutting-edge immersive tech. At that point it was the Oculus Rift, Microsoft HoloLens and things like Digital Twin simulation. Very cool stuff for a fresh grad to work on and very fast paced! </p> <p> At the same time I tried to complete my MSc Comp Sci &amp; Games Dev post-grad. Big mistake! Working full time, studying full time and dealing with other personal issues simultaneously was impossible. I managed to complete about 75% of my post-grad with a whole lot of stress when something exceptional arrived... (it wasn't me. I was already there!). </p> <p> <strong>Professionalism &amp; Confidence</strong> <br> I was personally headhunted by a global client with whom I worked closely during my work with the University. They reached out to hire me for a very ambitious project and wanted me to design it <em>from scratch</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>build a team to deliver it</em>. I couldn't say no as a graduate with only a year and bit of work under my belt. I dropped out of my MSc (I'll come back to you one day, I promise!) and shifted jobs. </p> <p> This new job accelerated my skillset to new heights. I learned business, I learned team leadership and management, I gained experience throughout the entire development pipeline. I met a true leader here who inspired me and redefined what my values were as a person and as a professional. Eventually I felt like I had reached my peak at the company and left for a fast paced indie start up in the games sector. </p> <p> It was here that I enjoyed full time remote working in a Senior position (it was in my title too!). I learned what it meant to have a truly comfortable working environment. Believe it or not, my house is actually where I keep all the stuff I like! That really helps with mental health and motivation! Everyone at the company was great, all very talented and fully embraced the remote working aspect. It was during this period I got diagnosed with combined ADHD (which explains like 35 years of bumbling through life...). However, shortly before the faithful Christmas of 2023, I was told my position was no longer feasible for the company, effective mid-January of 2024! Easy come, easy go; that's the start-up life for you! </p> <p> <strong>Reflection &amp; the Future</strong> <br> I'm sure my tale bored you to tears and that's fine. This was more of an exercise for me to truly tell my story. Even if only my ears hear my echo, the words were worth saying. Anyway, that's roughly where I'm at now! Bereft of employment, thoroughly medicated and incredibly motivated to get stuff done! That's why my portfolio site is finally getting finished after a decade! Okay, now that was a deep fireside chat, so let's talk about more fun stuff now, shall we? </p> </div> </details> <hr> <details> <summary> <strong>Core Values</strong> - A kind word can save a life. </summary> <div class="profile float-left"> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p> <br> <strong>My Core Values</strong> <br> During my brief ~36 years in this mortal coil, I have met amazing and not-so-amazing people, I have had great experiences and negative experiences. I have learned many lessons through pain and through success. All of these have influenced how I choose to live my life. I have three key values that I assertively apply everywhere I can. I try to spread the message as progressively and as far-reaching as I possibly can. But I'm happy if I can change the situation for even one person. </p> <p> <strong>Mental Health Awareness &amp; Well-Being</strong> <br> I have had my own mental health struggles over the years. Battling for as long as I can remember against undiagnosed ADHD. The spiral into depression because of that and the constant anxiety that I couldn't keep up with others without putting in 150% more effort. Now that I understand my unique brain and it's limitations, I decided to stand up as an advocate for Mental Health Awareness and especially Well-Being. I not only spread awareness of these topics wherever I go, I also advocate loudly within the companies I work for to ensure that we're supporting, empowering and compassionately handling professionals who suffer from these awful illnesses. The state of the world right now is a Mental Health Crisis and I will always stand up and do my part to help support those in need. No one deserves to feel lost and alone and no one deserves to feel the loss of a loved one because of it. </p> <p> <strong>Disability Awareness &amp; Rights in the Workplace</strong> <br> As a sufferer of MADD, ADHD and Crohn's Disease, I have a fair amount of experience dealing with the negatives of disabilities. Unmanaged and unmedicated, these illnesses would destroy my life completely. Even managed and medicated, they still make a negative impact on my day-to-day, but we're talking about a difference of 2% vs 98%. Unfortunately, many people and businesses don't fully understand the severity of these challenges faced by workers with disabilities. 'Reasonable Adjustments' are often not sufficient to support an employee to produce their best work. I stand up and advocate for improvements to policy; particularly, sickness and absence policy, remote/hybrid working and flexibility in hours. Supporting and allowing a worker to define their own work environment enables them to optimise it for their own unique personal challenges so they can take them out of the equation and focus purely on adding value to your business. Remember, equity not equals. We have to support those with disabilities who face unique challenges and help to raise them up and empower them. Not slap them with the "It works for everyone else." policy. </p> <p> <strong>Human-First, Employee-Second Leadership</strong> <br> I'm a human. You're a human (hopefully). We're all humans. No matter our title, our salary, our challenges or our attitude - we're all human in the end. I advocate that real leaders are there to support, facilitate and help their team(s) beyond just a professional/business duty. We have a duty to look after our people on a personal level too. This ties in to my other beliefs. A real leader doesn't demand better output and quote policy, they ask, "Why has this happened and how can we fix it together?". A real leader uses discretion to ensure that an employee has more good days than bad days; and when the bad days hit, workload, scheduling and environment can be adjusted to support that employee in their unique challenges. There is no 'blanket' workflow. There are only workflows that work for individuals and those that do not. When you have the opportunity to support another human, we should always seek to do so. That "Take the rest of the day off, don't worry." or "No problem, work remotely for today and let me know how you feel tomorrow." could save a life. </p> </div> </details> <hr> <details> <summary> <strong>Companions</strong> - What would an adventure be without a party? </summary> <div class="profile float-right"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/kev_n_the_kevs-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/kev_n_the_kevs-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/kev_n_the_kevs-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="(min-width: 800px) 231.0px, (min-width: 576px) 30vw, 95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/kev_n_the_kevs.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="kev_n_the_kevs.jpg" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> <div class="more-info"> Any excuse for a meme, really. </div> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p> <br> <strong>Words of Wisdom</strong> <br> Along our journey, we meet so many different souls. Many of them we may never see again after our first interaction, others become life-long friends and partners, whom we share our entire lives with in one way or another. Friends, colleagues, acquaintances, family, partners, pets. Much like the wonderful world of game physics, every interaction nudges the direction of our life slightly. The good interactions push us with inspiration, happiness and fulfilment. The bad interactions throw us around like a ragdoll, bouncing our life an feelings everywhere. I really hope I never reach Half-Life ragdoll level of emotional turmoil. I like my bones intact, thank you very much. </p> <p> As you can imagine for anyone who has ever ventured outside their house at least once (honest, it happened!), I've met a whole bunch of people. I consider most of these my friends that I care for very much. In this section, I would like to basically praise them for being the unique, amazing people that they are and describe the impact they've had on me. You should always tell those close to you and those who have had a positive impact how much you genuinely appreciate them. No one gets to hear that enough in their life. </p> <p> Okay, so I've definitely got to praise my friends or I'll never hear the end of the complaining! Now, I can't cover all of the hundreds of people I call my friends in some capacity, so I'll only go over the closest of the close and those who had the greatest impact on me. Over the decades, I've collected a large menagerie of varied individuals within the absurd and ridiculous 'Danger Zone' I call my various friendship circles. </p> <p> <strong>The Muse</strong> <br> First, I need to praise my fianc√© of one and a bit years (at the time of writing!). She's been my rock throughout our time together and has helped me to not only understand who I really am underneath the layers of stress-mitigation armour and years of challenges, but to also help me grow as a person for my future. She is incredibly empathic, understanding and so very caring. But she's also incredibly talented and intuitive. A fine artist in her own right, despite her own challenges, she has always stoked my imagination and creativity, pushing me to be more innovative and unorthodox in my approaches to everything I do. She's also incredibly funny, which matches my happy-go-lucky and joking personality. She taught me how to fully enjoy and immerse myself in the things that make me happy and passionate. All of this comes together to define who I am now; a passionate and driven creative with an unshakeable momentum and an unstoppable force of technical aptitude and compassionate leadership. </p> <p> <strong>The Wordsmith</strong> <br> I have a best friend who is a very stalwart, stoic person. Under the layers of unflinching hardiness, lies a truly talented creative with a penchant for wordsmithing. He can spin a fancy yarn out of any old thing. He's been my buddy since I made my first steps into Nursery (I think its the UK's Kindergarten equivalent) when I was around 4 years old. His constant camaraderie has been a comfort for me and spending evenings playing crap games and just having a laugh has got me through many hard times, more than even he might know. We're both getting on in years now but we're still thick as thieves. About as mischievous as well! </p> <p> <strong>The Genius</strong> <br> Another friend of mine is a very talented developer, practically a genius. I met him while I was studying at university but at this point, he could be a CTO! But he prefers the comfortable life of stability and doing what he loves; programming. I made the mistake of comparing myself to him in university, but as the years went on, I realised that its not about comparison, its about inspiration. I took notes of his advice, improving my own approaches and used his incredible talent to inspire me to grow my own. </p> <p> <strong>The Jokester</strong> <br> While I was at university, I met another unique individual. He struggled a lot with his confidence when programming (even though his code was great) but he had a huge personality. Always laughing, joking and for some reason; eating. But he kept our spirits up constantly. He's a great guy and is doing really well in his career nowadays! He taught me that no matter what we're doing, where we're doing it or why we're doing it; there's always a bright-side or a chance for you to raise the spirits of others nearby. It took me awhile to appreciate this, but I owe it to this bloke for that lesson. </p> <p> <strong>The Leader</strong> <br> Later in my career, I met a true exemplar for real leadership. He wasn't just a 'boss', he was a supportive friend, compassion colleague and amazing person in general. He taught me what it REALLY meant to be a leader. That its a responsibility for people, not 'a team' or 'the business'. He always adopted a supportive role, facilitating whatever tools we needed to get our job done, no matter the task at hand or working environment. But he also knew we were human. We all had our own personal struggles, me especially, and he always treated me like a human first, employee second. No matter the issue, he was there to support me through it, regardless of what the business stated was to happen in that situation. I learned a lot about leadership from this guy and he instilled within me one of my core values that I carry to this day. </p> <p> <strong>The Family</strong> <br> Naturally I have to thank my family too! My parents for ripping me from the ocean of souls and imprisoning me in this mortal cage made of meat. But also, for gifting me the drive, passion and creativity that empowers my every action and decision in life. My siblings, 3 brothers and a sister, for their endless support and encouragement throughout my life, even when I wasn't the best older brother to them. Especially my late brother, who despite leaving us far too early, still inspires me to this day to help and support as many people as possible through this awful mental health crisis. </p> </div> </details> <hr> <details> <summary> <strong>Hobbies</strong> - I have to do something <em>other</em> than work, you know! Yes, <em>besides</em> sleeping... </summary> <div class="profile float-left"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/the_cat_conspiracy_closeup-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/the_cat_conspiracy_closeup-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/the_cat_conspiracy_closeup-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="(min-width: 800px) 231.0px, (min-width: 576px) 30vw, 95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/the_cat_conspiracy_closeup.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded-circle" width="100%" height="auto" alt="the_cat_conspiracy_closeup.jpg" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p> <br> <strong>Overview</strong> <br> So under this professional guise I put forth into the world, I have a mishmash of other interests that I enjoy at least semi-regularly. Naturally, I enjoy programming and gaming. It's why I got into games development in the first place! I also enjoy world building, which I do through my creative writing. I enjoy reading for that same reason! And there are a couple of others that I have been working on steadily but I'm still not great at. </p> <p> <strong>Programming</strong> <br> I absolutely love programming. And I especially love games programming. My day jobs have usually eaten up all of my daily programming capacity, but I recently find myself with more energy and time to work on my own stuff! So I've been digging out old projects across my talents and seeing what could use a good dusting off! My partner and I are also working on a tiny indie game together, to see how far we get! I love talking about code. I love talking about designs and I love doing both. </p> <p> <strong>Gaming</strong> <br> I've been an avid gamer ever since I was about 4 years old. I have kept this passion and interest throughout my life, amassing a library of over 850+ games on my Steam account. If I factor in all the games I've bought for other platforms, we're well over 1000+. I love story-heavy games like RPGs but I also love the tension and planning for first-person survival and/or extraction shooters. For me, it's not all about fun; its also about what a game makes me feel and I love it when they make me feel immersed. </p> <p> <strong>Creative Writing</strong> <br> Oh boy, this is a big one for me. When the inspiration and passion strikes me, I can write until its 4am and not even realise. I have an Epic of over 100k+ words all about a space marine punching space clowns. In space. I love parody, satire, comedy and absurdism. I was inspired as a young lad and fledgling writer by the great comedy geniuses of Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams. Able to tell a humorous story without detracting from the depth of the world and characters. They bring everything together into a kind of 'grounded ridiculousness' that I put a lot of effort to repeat through their inspiration. My favourite settings are High Fantasy, Science-Fiction and Modern Day - but I turn them into absurdist parodies of themselves. It's quite fun actually! </p> <p> <strong>Reading</strong> <br> I love reading as a way to wind-down in the evenings. From Shorts to Epics, I love them all. Whether its Stephen King's <em>The Jaunt</em> to Tolkien's legendary <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, Orwell's classic <em>1984</em> to Pratchett's hysterical <em>The Colour of Magic</em>, I love them all! I have such a massive backlog of fiction to read that at this point, I don't think I'll ever manage to read them all! </p> <p> <strong>Violin</strong> <br> Now, let me preface this by saying I have never had any musical aptitude. My natural gift was always science, not the arts! But the Violin is an incredibly beautiful instrument, each draw of the bow across the strings pulls at my heartstrings. So I endeavoured to learn how to produce such beautiful sounds from it! In between my other hobbies and lack of time during working over the years, this hobby of mine has laid dormant for far too long. When circumstances permit, I will definitely be picking up lessons from a professional! </p> <p> <strong>Languages</strong> <br> When someone asks me what languages I know, my first instinct is always to list off my programming languages. That should give you some inkling as to how varied my human linguistics are - the answer is not at all. I know one language fluently and it's English. Because I'm a UK national. I decided to learn German as my fianc√© is German and I think it's the least I could do is to learn her native language. Not just out of consideration for her and her family, but also so that I can enjoy my visits to Germany more naturally by speaking to people in their own native tongue (if they want to, of course!). </p> </div> </details> <hr> <details> <summary> <strong>Disabilities</strong> - Trigger warnings, but helpline numbers inside. </summary> <div class="profile float-left"> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p> <br> <strong>Awareness &amp; Understanding</strong> <br> This section might seem weirdly personal, but I'm an open book about these subjects. Awareness is the key to understanding. This understanding cures ignorance and creates a compassionate and open environment for us to discuss and find solutions to treat, manage, support people with and ultimately, remove these horrible conditions from our society. I want to highlight some of the challenges, effects pre- and post-medication/treatment and the impact these have had on my life. I hope these short paragraphs of my own experiences with these illnesses can help to highlight the difficulty that people with disabilities can face on a daily basis. Time to discuss my three major health hurdles: Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder (MADD), combined Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Crohn's Disease (that's Mr Crohns to you!). </p> <p> If you're struggling with your mental health, please reach out to a mental health service as soon as you can. You deserve better.

My life-long partner through life. It's an autoimmune disease that makes your own immune system attack your gastrointestinal (GI) tract, very often triggered by eating regular food. Usually impacting the lower GI tract like the intestines, it can cause massive inflammation in there, causing significant pain and discomfort. Not to mention the other very unfun symptoms like requiring the loo frequently (to put it politely), constant fatigue and exhaustion, inability to sleep and malnutrition. Now, malnutrition might not sound like a big deal, but having it from a young age means that your body doesn't have enough useful materials to grow properly. Your brain will hog most of it first and the rest of you gets the scraps. If those scraps aren't enough, you'll end up with abnormalities in growth such as weaker bones, smaller body frame, etc. These 'side effects' will spawn additional issues. </p> <p> I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease at 5, but my parents struggled to feed me since birth. I'd refuse to eat and cry often due to pain. This means that doctors think I've had it since birth. I've already covered some of its impact in my Origin Story section. But growing up, I never had the energy to do much. I wasn't able to eat much of anything and when I found something that minimised my suffering after eating, I'd simply just eat that all the time. After my operation and all the complications were handled (thanks NHS!), I was finally able to make a start on my life properly but it had irreparably damaged my childhood and social life to the point where I was socially anxious. I had been forced to live a sheltered life due to it and wasn't as 'worldly' as my peers. </p> <p> Now as an adult, I still get regualar discomfort and I definitely need the loo a lot, but its managed and its been in what my Consultant Gastroenterologist calls 'remission'. As in, the majority of extreme symptoms are currently gone. There is always the possibility of a 'flare-up', which could put me in a very bad place health-wise, but I won't fear for my future because a disability. I consider my diet very carefully, ensuring that I avoid eating anything with my known discomfort 'triggers' in my food. I still have bad days where getting off the toilet for longer than 20minutes is impossible, but with the adoption of remote working as a regular approach by companies, I no longer have to worry about a CODE: BROWN emergency happening on my commute or being very late because I couldn't get off the loo. </p> <p> For more information on Crohn's Disease, see the NHS website here: <br> <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/crohns-disease/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/crohns-disease/</a>! <br> You can find the official Crohn's &amp; Colitis UK charity here, if you wish to aid research and support for indivdiuals: <br> <a href="https://crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/</a>! </p> <p> <strong>Combined Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</strong> <br> ADHD is hard to explain. Many people think it's a fidgeting, loud or disruptive child, but that's only a small part of it. Many ADHD sufferers don't display the hyperactivity portion or display it in very muted ways. ADHD has two components to it: Inattentive (this is the AD part of the ADHD) and Hyperactive-Impulsive (this is the H part of it). You can have one or the other, or both as a combined presentation. There's so many symptoms that differ across sufferers in both presence and severity that I don't even know where to start. Oh, actually, let's just go through how it affected me! </p> <p> I was diagnosed with combined ADHD in November 2023. Not too long ago from me writing this. Prior to that, all throughout my life, I struggled with many things I thought were just how I was as a person. Now, let me preface this by saying that within my professional life, the momentum I kept drove me to develop coping mechanisms so the impact in my worklife was mitigated. But within my personal life, I was never able to complete any of my own personal goals. I thought that I was simply a career person and accomplishing my dreams outside of that were simply not feasible for a person like me. I could sit down in front of my workstation, have the time, money, energy, desire, plans and tools to make a game, but I couldn't. Not because I didn't know how, I've dedicated my professional life to games technology, but my brain just wouldn't 'go'. It's hard to explain, but this is one of the most severe and debilitating symptoms; Executive Dysfunction. Anyone who has never had to suffer with this would find it hard to believe. You want or need and are fully capable of doing something, but <b>can't</b>. My brain just wouldn't do it. Other fun symptoms are (but are not limited to) none-stop racing thoughts, obsession on a single thought, inability to follow societal norms/cues, dopamine-seeking behavior like rapid context-switching, easily distracted, inability to focus. </p> <p> Shortly after my diagnosis and tests to ensure I was compatible with any medications, I began the treatment regime of stimulants. At first, it only seemed to slow my thoughts slightly. It was nice to experience that literal 'peace of mind', but my Executive Dysfunction and inability to maintain focus was my major hurdles. My psychiatrist and I agreed that an aggressive approach in increasing my dosage would be the best option. It wasn't until mid-January 2024 that I reached a dose where my brain stopped fighting me and started supporting me! It's hard to describe the change. I went from struggling to get even the smallest thing done in my personal life to sitting down and working 12+ hours a day without realising. I went from lacking motivation to do chores, shopping or even go outside to being incredibly outgoing, sociable and assertive. The pills didn't change my personality so to say, rather it allowed me to be <em>more</em> <b>ME</b>! Now I'm driven, passionate, unyielding and empowered. My love for learning, my hobbies, my craft and the people in my life all came back almost overnight on this dose. I was finally able to live my life how I wanted to live, not just in the directions my brain smelled dopamine. </p> <p> For more information on ADHD, see the NHS website here: <br> <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/</a>! <br> You can find the the ADHD Foundation Neurodiversity Charity website here, if you wish to aid research, supporting individuals and education/awareness: <br> <a href="https://www.adhdfoundation.org.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.adhdfoundation.org.uk/</a>! </p> <p> <strong>Anxiety</strong> <br> Everyone has anxiety. But people with clinical anxiety have far too much of it. It impacts being able to take action easily. A person may overthink to the point of breakdown or they might overthink to the point that they convince themselves they can't do the action or try to avoid the action. This can even happen with simple, daily tasks like washing the dishes or cleaning the house. This results in missing opportunities in life, not living life to the fullest and becoming isolated and sheltered from the world due to fear. </p> <p> I was diagnosed with MADD probably around 2020. So I haven't really had treatment and management for it very long. But as far back as I can remember, I've always struggled with fear of doing the unknown or being able to handle every situation. My imposter syndrome voice was <b>very</b> loud throughout my life. I remember passing my driving test and having the freedom to go anywhere right in front of me, but my anxiety wouldn't let me drive, even though I was fully qualified. For my professional life, I pushed through as best I could, knowing that academic and business duties were very well defined really helped. Everything was tightly controlled, but I spent a lot of my adult life dealing with that fear and missing out on a lot of experiences. </p> <p> Prior to my ADHD medication, I was on an anti-depressant medication. This didn't really help with my depression but it basically cured my anxiety. It was very freeing to not second guess everything I decided or wanted to do. But I still felt hurdles in my mental health. I wasn't able to motivate outside of work and I didn't feel that passion for my hobbies or my relationships. But without my anxiety pills, I was wrecked with social and general anxiety, overthinking and analysis paralysis. I still didn't feel like me, but I struggled on thinking that this was the normal for me. </p> <p> For more information on General Anxiety (other flavours of Anxiety are available on the NHS website too), see the NHS website here: <br> <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder/</a>! <br> You can find the Anxiety UK Charity website here, if you wish to aid research and supporting indivdiduals with Anxiety: <br> <a href="https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/</a>! </p> <p> <strong>Depression</strong> <br> Depression is a sinister condition. It sucks the joy out of your life. It hides your passion, desires and happiness under a thick black blanket that is far too heavy to lift right now. You find no enjoyment in your hobbies, your social life or your work anymore. You struggle to find the motivation to even get out of bed. It makes you question your worth as a professional, as a friend/partner and most worryingly, your worth as a person. This is what can drive people over the edge where we lose them forever. </p> <p> I don't know how long I've had depression. I was often moving so fast through life, I never really got to sit down and consider what I truly, deeply enjoyed in life. I know I loved gaming, but I didn't realize that the joy I experienced was a very shallow joy because I didn't know any better! The condition conspires against you to make you think this is how it should feel; this empty, hollow low quality insult to what real joy should be. But it doesn't have to be like that. </p> <p> When I finally got a diagnosis for ADHD, got medicated and I approached that perfect dosage, I started to feel the desire to do my hobbies (it's why this portfolio site exists now!), to truly enjoy things in life and my passion sparked back to life to be creative and make people smile and laugh. Before that depression was persistent. It refuse to leave me alone completely, even when life was doing great. I had tried therapy and medication and nothing worked. I guess I finally got rid of the symptom of depression when I handled the condition that was causing it; ADHD. </p> <p> For more information on Depression, see the NHS website here: <br> <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/depression-in-adults/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/depression-in-adults/</a>! <br> You can find the Mind UK Charity website here, if you wish to aid research and supporting indivdiduals with Depression: <br> <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.mind.org.uk/</a>! </p> </div> </details> <hr> <details> <summary> <strong>Cats</strong> - Always save the best until last! </summary> <div class="profile float-left"> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p> <br> <strong>The Grand Finale</strong> <br> Cats! Cats everywhere! A big part of my life are my cats; Arthas, the black and white tuxedo boy. He's 4 and a half. He's the boss around here. And Luna, the big tortoiseshell girl. She's 3 and a half and loves to eat. There's also little Loki, the voidling trickster. She's 2 and a half. She loves to zoom and play with Arthas! And last, but not least, there's Gismo! Gismo is my partner's 12 year old, chunky, tonkinese old man! He'll be joining us here in the mad house when my fianc√© and I lock down a wedding date. </p> <p> <strong>Arthas - The King</strong> <br> <img src="/assets/img/arthas_loki_playing.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded-circle" width="25%" height="auto" alt="Arthas the King!" align="right" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> This is Arthas! Named after the Lich King of the Scourge from World of Warcraft. Yes, it's nerdy. No, it wasn't <em>purely</em> my decision! Both myself and an ex gave him the rather geeky name. But I love him all the same. He was originally my sister's kitten, but due to circumstance, she wasn't able to keep him. Rather than him have to go to a shelter, I took him as my first cat. He's a sweet boy, but loves to show off that he runs the place to his little sisters. He's affectionate on his terms, but he loves a good nap during the day - especially if I can join him! He'll lay on my chest and go to sleep in a little loaf. </p> <p> <strong>Luna - The Queen</strong> <br> <img src="/assets/img/luna_n_toy.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded-circle" width="25%" height="auto" alt="Luna the Queen!" align="right" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> This is Luna! She's the QUEEN of the house! She's not <em>a</em> queen, all my cat-children are neutered, but she runs around acting like the Queen! She's big, but so gentle and timid. She is easily scared by conflict, loud noises and new people. Rather than drop Arthas with a well placed swipe from her big beefy paw, she'd rather run away out of his reach and go to sleep. She absolutely LOVES food. She cannot regulate her own eating! I had to buy 3 microchip-locked feeders just because this big lady wouldn't stop eating <em>everything</em>! Luna was a shelter-cat that my ex and I took on to give the beautiful lady a new, loving home. </p> <p> <strong>Loki - The Trickster</strong> <br> <img src="/assets/img/loki.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded-circle" width="25%" height="auto" alt="Loki the Trickster!" align="right" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> This is Loki! She lives up to her name. She mischiefs, she pranks and plays with her brother and sister and on occasion, she has driven me to insanity! But I love her anyway. She's tiny for a cat of her age, but her kitten-like looks just go with her forever-kitten-like personality! She loves to hop up to me in the middle of my working, head bump my face and then hop onto my lap and curl up to sleep. As everyone knows, it is the law to allow a cat to sleep on you. Or face the penalty of claws. </p> <p> <strong>Gismo - The soon-to-be King</strong> <br> <img src="/assets/img/gismo.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded-circle" width="25%" height="auto" alt="Gismo the REAL King!!" align="right" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> Gismo is the REAL king! Gismo is a chunky boy who <em>loves</em> pets. He loves and wants attention from my fianc√© all the time. He loves his belly scratches and once he moves in with me and my cat-kids, he'll definitely claim Arthas' throne as the one true King of the cat colony! </p> </div> </details> </article> </div> </article> <hr> <a href="#" style="margin:auto; text-align:center; display:block" class="button large hpbottom">Return to Top</a> <br> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%6B%65%76%69%6E%62%61%72%72.%62%75%73%69%6E%65%73%73@%67%6D%61%69%6C.%63%6F%6D" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/kjb88" title="GitHub" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-barr1988" title="LinkedIn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note"> The best way to reach me directly is via email, no matter the reason.<br> However, feel free to connect with me via LinkedIn. </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> ¬© Copyright 2024 Kevin Barr.
