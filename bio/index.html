You ready for the story of Kev yet?</div> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p> <br> <strong>Speedrun of Me. Any%</strong> <br> Hi, I'm Kev! A thirty-something ADHD fella, struggling with sparse facial hair. You'll find me somewhere under a pile of cats! My partner-in-crime is a very tall German lady who is my inspiration, my muse and my emotional coach through life. </p> <p> Like a typical human being, there's a lot to me. I'm driven, passionate, free-spirited and confident. I have a strong set of core values I adhere to, no matter where or what I'm doing in life. I have a few hobbies; trying (and failing) to learn the violin, creative writing, reading, hobbyist games dev, petting cats and gaming. One of those 'hobbies' cutely insists on a lot more attention than the others. Can you guess which one? </p> <p> <strong>Speedrun of Me. Handicapped but Determined.</strong> <br> I suffer with a few select items of poor genetics! Crohn's Disease, ADHD and MADD. Because of these disabilities, I'm a vocal advocate for Mental Health Awareness and Wellbeing, Disability Rights in the Workplace and a 'Human-First, Employee-Second' approach to Leadership. I believe in Trust, Integrity, Compassion and Support. We're all humans, so let's all treat each other like humans first and foremost. I'll get my protest board out and give you the lecture later! </p> <p> <strong>Speedrun of Me. Tool-Assisted Speedrun</strong> <br> I won't get too deep into my professional life, but I've been working with Unity and C# for a decade. Straight out of university, basically. Ahhh, what a fresh-faced young developer I was! I do enjoy some personal programming with other tools though. I made a Discord Bot to annoy my friends, plenty of MonoGame/XNA stuff in the past. I'm trying my luck with Godot and Unreal Engine. And I really miss my time working at a very low-level with C++. It might be time to get back on that too! </p> <p> You can find information below about my values, my hobbies, my background and, of course, my cats! Well, if you're interested that is! </p> </div> </details> <hr> <details> <summary> <strong>ORIGIN STORY</strong> - It's time for 'A Brief History of Kev'! *<em>jazz hands</em>* </summary> <div class="profile float-left"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/brief_history_of_kev-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/brief_history_of_kev-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/brief_history_of_kev-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="(min-width: 800px) 231.0px, (min-width: 576px) 30vw, 95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/brief_history_of_kev.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded-circle" width="100%" height="auto" alt="brief_history_of_kev.jpg" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> <div class="more-info">It's a real picture! Honest. I swear.</div> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p> <br> <strong>Youth &amp; Curiosity</strong> <br> I'm an East Yorkshire lad, born in the maritime city of Hull in the UK. From a very early age, I was into video games. One of my earliest memories is playing Sonic 3 (&amp; Knuckles!) upwards of 8 hours a day, every day. My dad introduced me to the wider world of PC precursor systems: the Commodore 64 then the Amiga 1200. I grew up playing the likes of Beach Head, Elite then Syndicate, UFO: Enemy Unknown and Cannon Fodder. Nothing like defending Earth from the Alien menace to really inspire a young mind! </p> <p> As I grew up, the question of where games actually came from started to form in my the space between my ears. During my tween years, I tried my best to figure it out. But a council estate lad who lives off microwave chips and dinosaur nuggies doesn't merely stumble across a Brackey's games development tutorial during the late nineties and early naughties. I did, however, stumble across random development applications like RPGMaker, a small private server community for an early naughties online MMO called Graal Online. These exploratory options </p> <p> <strong>Biology &amp; Freedom</strong> <br> It was around this time I had a major hurdle in my life. My Crohn's disease, a rather grumpy and inconsiderate partner-slash-condition I had been carrying around since birth, decided it'd had enough of my gluttonous love for turkey dinosaurs and soggy potatoes and came for revenge. Homestuck due to the pain, exhaustion and 'less fun' symptoms, I spent my time playing PSX and N64 games with infrequent home-education provided by my school. I eventually had a major operation called an intestinal bisection, which just sounds like someone went in there with a pair of scissors. This really helped, but caused lots of complications during recovery. I think I missed the entire final 4 years of secondary school education. I still sat my GCSES; 2 Cs and 2 Ds for the core subjects. Not bad for someone who barely studied for almost the entirety of secondary school! </p> <p> Anyway, onto a slightly better time after that! With my health somewhat improved and free from the shackles of mandatory education; I went into optional education instead! To the realms of Sixth Form College I go! I met a lot of good friends here, peers who are out in the world now making a change. I studied the only IT / CompSci relevant subject available; 'IT Practitioners', both as a 'First Diploma' and a 'National Diploma', whatever those are. After that, I decided that education wasn't for me right now and had that whole 'find your purpose in life' phase. </p> <p> Now we skip over a large portion of my life which I have aptly named the 'Blunder Years'. Because it was just me blundering around, making mistakes and trying to find a purpose in life. Instead, I found Mixed Depression and Anxiety Disorder (MADD) and I can't find anyone to buy it off me so I'm stuck with it. This must be why they say impulse purchases are bad. </p> <p> <strong>Velocity &amp; Passion</strong> <br> In my late twenties, I decided to give university life a shot. I'd tried everything else, may as well get into a few tens of thousand quid worth of debt. I hesitantly and anxiously applied for the BSc in Computer Science with Games Development at the University of Hull. And I was accepted! With a conditional of doing the Foundation Year. Works for me! I took to it like a duck to a dinner plate. I grew both academically and personally, I met great colleagues, friends and peers. I learned an incredible amount of knowledge and put in 150% wherever I could. It felt like I was born for programming and learning. I graduated with a First Class because of all the momentum and drive I had. </p> <p> I got my first real programming job here too! I worked in academia as a Unity developer for the Business School at the University of Hull. Another graduate and I worked on contracts and showcase pieces that the University felt would highlight their cutting-edge immersive tech. At that point it was the Oculus Rift, Microsoft HoloLens and things like Digital Twin simulation. Very cool stuff for a fresh grad to work on and very fast paced! </p> <p> At the same time I tried to complete my MSc Comp Sci &amp; Games Dev post-grad. Big mistake! Working full time, studying full time and dealing with other personal issues simultaneously was impossible. I managed to complete about 75% of my post-grad with a whole lot of stress when something exceptional arrived... (it wasn't me. I was already there!). </p> <p> <strong>Professionalism &amp; Confidence</strong> <br> I was personally headhunted by a global client with whom I worked closely during my work with the University. They reached out to hire me for a very ambitious project and wanted me to design it <em>from scratch</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>build a team to deliver it</em>. I couldn't say no as a graduate with only a year and bit of work under my belt. I dropped out of my MSc (I'll come back to you one day, I promise!) and shifted jobs. </p> <p> This new job accelerated my skillset to new heights. I learned business, I learned team leadership and management, I gained experience throughout the entire development pipeline. I met a true leader here who inspired me and redefined what my values were as a person and as a professional. Eventually I felt like I had reached my peak at the company and left for a fast paced indie start up in the games sector. </p> <p> It was here that I enjoyed full time remote working in a Senior position (it was in my title too!). I learned what it meant to have a truly comfortable working environment. Believe it or not, my house is actually where I keep all the stuff I like! That really helps with mental health and motivation! Everyone at the company was great, all very talented and fully embraced the remote working aspect. It was during this period I got diagnosed with ADHD (which explains like 35 years of bumbling through life...). However, shortly before the faithful Christmas of 2023, I was told my position was no longer feasible for the company, effective mid-January of 2024! Easy come, easy go; that's the start-up life for you! </p> <p> <strong>Reflection &amp; the Future</strong> <br> I'm sure my tale bored you to tears and that's fine. This was more of an exercise for me to truly tell my story. Even if only my ears hear my echo, the words were worth saying. Anyway, that's roughly where I'm at now! Bereft of employment, thoroughly medicated and incredibly motivated to get stuff done! That's why my portfolio site is finally getting finished after a decade! Okay, now that was a deep fireside chat, so let's talk about more fun stuff now, shall we? </p> </div> </details> <hr> <details> <summary> <strong>COMPANIONS</strong> - What would an adventure be without a party? </summary> <div class="profile float-right"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/kev_n_the_kevs-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/kev_n_the_kevs-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/kev_n_the_kevs-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="(min-width: 800px) 231.0px, (min-width: 576px) 30vw, 95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/kev_n_the_kevs.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="kev_n_the_kevs.jpg" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> <div class="more-info">Any excuse for a meme, really.</div> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p> <br> <strong>Words of Wisdom</strong> <br> Along our journey, we meet so many different souls. Many of them we may never see again after our first interaction, others become life-long friends and partners, whom we share our entire lives with in one way or another. Friends, colleagues, acquaitances, family, partners, pets. Much like the wonderful world of game physics, every interaction nudges the direction of our life slightly. The good interactions push us with inspiration, happiness and fulfillment. The bad interactions throw us around like a ragdoll, bouncing our life an feelings everywhere. I really hope I never reach Half-Life ragdoll level of emotional turmoil. I like my bones intact, thank you very much. </p> <p> As you can imagine for anyone who has ever ventured outside their house at least once (honest, it happened!), I've met a whole bunch of people. I consider most of these my friends that I care for very much. In this section, I would like to basically praise them for being the unique, amazing people that they are and describe the impact they've had on me. You should always tell those close to you and those who have had a positive impact how much you genuinely appreciate them. No one gets to hear that enough in their life. </p> <p> Okay, so I've definitely got to praise my friends or I'll never hear the end of the complaining! Now, I can't cover all of the hundreds of people I call my friends in some capacity, so I'll only go over the closest of the close and those who had the greatest impact on me. Over the decades, I've collected a large menagerie of varied indivduals within the absurd and ridiculous 'Danger Zone' I call my various friendship circles. </p> <p> <strong>The Muse</strong> <br> First, I need to praise my fiancé of one and a bit years (at the time of writing!). She's been my rock throughout our time together and has helped me to not only understand who I really am underneath the layers of stress-mitigation armour and years of challenges, but to also help me grow as a person for my future. She is incredibly empathic, understanding and so very caring. But she's also incredibly talented and intuitive. A fine artist in her own right, despite her own challenges, she has always stoked my imagination and creativity, pushing me to be more innovative and unorthodox in my approaches to everything I do. She's also incredibly funny, which matches my happy-go-lucky and joking personality. She taught me how to fully enjoy and immerse myself in the things that make me happy and passionate. All of this comes together to define who I am now; a passionate and driven creative with an unshakeable momentum and an unstoppable force of technical aptitude and compassionate leadership. </p> <p> <strong>The Wordsmith</strong> <br> I have a best friend who is a very stalwart, stoic person. Under the layers of unflinching hardiness, lies a truly talented creative with a penchant for wordsmithing. He can spin a fancy yarn out of any old thing. He's been my buddy since I made my first steps into Nursery (I think its the UK's Kindergarten equivalent) when I was around 4 years old. His constant camaraderie has been a comfort for me and spending evenings playing crap games and just having a laugh has got me through many hard times, more than even he might know. We're both getting on in years now but we're still thick as thieves. About as mischievous as well! </p> <p> <strong>The Genius</strong> <br> Another friend of mine is a very talented developer, practically a genius. I met him while I was studying at university but at this point, he could be a CTO! But he prefers the comfortable life of stability and doing what he loves; programming. I made the mistake of comparing myself to him in university, but as the years went on, I realised that its not about comparison, its about inspiration. I took notes of his advice, improving my own approaches and used his incredible talent to inspire me to grow my own. </p> <p> <strong>The Jokester</strong> <br> While I was at university, I met another unique individual. He struggled a lot with his confidence when programming (even though his code was great) but he had a huge personality. Always laughing, joking and for some reason; eating. But he kept our spirits up constantly. He's a great guy and is doing really well in his career nowadays! He taught me that no matter what we're doing, where we're doing it or why we're doing it; there's always a bright-side or a chance for you to raise the spirits of others nearby. It took me awhile to appreciate this, but I owe it to this bloke for that lesson. </p> <p> <strong>The Leader</strong> <br> Later in my career, I met a true exemplar for real leadership. He wasn't just a 'boss', he was a supportive friend, compassion colleague and amazing person in general. He taught me what it REALLY meant to be a leader. That its a responsibility for people, not 'a team' or 'the business'. He always adopted a supportive role, facilitating whatever tools we needed to get our job done, no matter the task at hand or working environment. But he also knew we were human. We all had our own personal struggles, me especially, and he always treated me like a human first, employee second. No matter the issue, he was there to support me through it, regardless of what the business stated was to happen in that situation. I learned a lot about leadership from this guy and he instilled within me one of my core values that I carry to this day. </p> <p> <strong>The Family</strong> <br> Naturally I have to thank my family too! My parents for ripping me from the ocean of souls and imprisoning me in this mortal cage made of meat. But also, for gifting me the drive, passion and creativity that empowers my every action and decision in life. My siblings, 3 brothers and a sister, for their endless support and encouragement throughout my life, even when I wasn't the best older brother to them. Especially my late brother, who despite leaving us far too early, still inspires me to this day to help and support as many people as possible through this awful mental health crisis. </p> </div> </details> <hr> <details> <summary> </summary> <div class="profile float-right"> </div> <div class="clearfix"> </div> </details> </article> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Kevin Barr.
